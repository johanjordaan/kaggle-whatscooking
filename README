The model for predicting is a one-vs-all logistic regression.

I achieved a 83% success of the training data and a 73% success on the test data.

The main area of improvement would probably be on how the 'features' (ingredients)
are and parsed. Some form of clustering on the ingredients would have been useful.

I only started this challenge very late so I did not have a lot of time to
work on this before the challenge finished.
